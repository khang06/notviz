This ports over some of the [pfavizkhang](https://github.com/khang06/PianoFromAbove) improvements in a way that doesn't affect playback performance. Why would you want that? I don't know!

## Ported features
* Faster loading for MIDIs with lots of overlapping notes
* Properly loads some corrupt MIDIs (e.g. NF53.1MIL.mid)
* Support for MIDIs over 2GB
